# Live Agora

... a playful space for exchange and sharing  

Live Agora offers collaborative 2D spaces where participants can meet, gather, and arrange various media (streams and files) together. Traces left in spaces are persisted, allowing groups to build collective memory to according to their own needs and values.

Please note: this is experimental software. Expect rough edges and evolving features.
